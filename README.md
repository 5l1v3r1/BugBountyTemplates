# Bug Bounty Templates
A collection of templates for bug bounty reporting, with guides on how to write and fill out. Not the core standard on how to report but certainly a flow I follow personally which has been successful for me. Your milage may vary.

Feel free to clone down, modify, suggest changes, tweet me ideas [@ZephrFish](https://twitter.com/ZephrFish).
